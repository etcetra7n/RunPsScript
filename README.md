# RunPsScript.exe

A small windows utility program for running powershell scripts silently (i.e. 
without a console window popping up). You could use this for places
where the console window always pops up by default. For example You
could use this to create right click menu automation in regedit 
([see example](https://gist.github.com/etcetra7n/569ee8a34eb773e5de917f653f921e0a))
